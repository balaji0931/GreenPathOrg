🔹 Features to Implement

🔓 Public Pages (Accessible Without Login)
🟢 Home Page (Most Important - Must Be Highly Informative & Engaging)

The home page should be visually appealing, interactive, and informative while maintaining a clean, structured layout.

A clear flowchart or steps (with small, smooth animations) to show how users can:

Icons should be well-designed, intuitive, and visually distinct.

Darker tones for text to ensure high visibility.
Small, Subtle Animations for Engagement:
Interactive Hover Effects (e.g., icons enlarge slightly when hovered).
Smooth transitions (e.g., when scrolling, elements appear dynamically).
Illustrations instead of static images where possible.
Sections Clearly Highlighting Each User Group:
Customers: How to report waste, track pickups, and earn points.
Dealers: Accept waste requests, segregate, assist customers.

🚀 Donation Section on All Pages (Encouraging Quotes & Impact Stories)
Quote: "Your waste can be someone’s treasure. Donate today and make a difference!"
Show images of successful donations helping orphanages, old-age homes, and shelters.
